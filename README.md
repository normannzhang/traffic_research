GAFL5310 End of Semester Data Science Research on Traffic Crashes in Chicago

BLUF: 
Only 2.67% of traffic crashes in Chicago are classified as severe — but they are concentrated in specific areas and strongly linked to modifiable conditions like poor lighting, missing traffic controls, and adverse road surfaces.

By identifying which conditions and locations are most associated with severe crashes, we can help the City of Chicago proactively reduce risk — not just respond after crashes happen.


Research Goals:
- Identify which conditions are most associated with severe crashes
- Build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a crash being severe based on environmental and roadway features
- Use model predictions to map high-risk zones across Chicago, helping policy makers allocate resources where they are more needed.
- Support data-driven public safety interventions such as upgrading intersections, adding signage, or adjusting speed limits.


- Use Logistic regression and other machine learning models to use and compare against each other with metric score, we can see significant predictors (p-values <0.05) and odds ratios to interpret severity impact.
